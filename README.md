# Computational workflow in Python for the `iris` dataset

In this example we'll load, process, visualize, and train a classifier for the [iris](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html) dataset, containing examples of different flowers and their physical characteristics.

## Setup

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for your system.

2. Create a `conda` environment using `conda env create -f env.yml` (from this folder).

## Run

1. Run `jupyter notebook` from this folder

2. Open [notebook.ipynb](notebook.ipynb) and run the cells 

3. The result, [model.png](model.png), will be written to disk
